#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
test is created by using cbind() to bind subjecttest,ytest and xtest.
train is created by using cbind() to bind subjecttrain,ytrain and xtrain.
Dataset is created by binding test and trains by rows.


#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
DataNames select cols of "subject","activity",and the second variable of features, which is converted to characters
meanstd is created by using grep to subset cols of DataNames containing suject,activity,mean or std.
Newdataset is created by indexing all the rows with meanstd cols of Dataset

#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
The two cols of activitylabels dataset is renamed into "activitynumber" and "activityname".
The activitynumber col is replaced by the 2nd col of activitiylabels.

#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
activitynumber column in the Newdataset renamed into activities
Using gsub() to substitute all the abbreviations into corresponding full names.

#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
tidydataset is created by using pipeline operater and grouped by activity and subject,sumarizing tidyData with the means of each variable for each activity and each subject.
