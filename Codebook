#Field names              Description
features             contains the data based on the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activitylabels       contains the activity name or labels and corresponding numbers
Subjecttest          contains different subjects performed in the test set
Xtest                contains data of various tests based on different functions 
ytest                contains labels of different activities in the test set
subjecttrain         contains different subjects performed in the subject set
xtrain               contains train data based on different functions
ytrain               contains labels of different activities in the train set 

#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X                    a combined data frame of xtrain and xtest
Y                    a combined data frame of ytrain and ytest
Subject              a combined data frame of subjecttrain and subjecttest
Dataset              a combined data frame of X,Y and Dataset

#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Extractdataset       a data frame containing subject,number,mean and std cols

#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Extractdataset$number the col renamed to the 2nd col of activitylabels, which is activity name


#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
names(Extractdataset)substitute all the abbreviations into corresponding full names.

#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
TIDYDATA            a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
"averaged.txt"      the final file of TIDYDATA is exported as a text format to the desktop
