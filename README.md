https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

#CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

#run_analysis.R performs the coding of this project,including:
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
variable for each activity and each subject.

#tidydataset.text is the final file after running all the code decribed above
